# CSC_Agility_Report

Hi Readers,

My name is Paul Colmer.  This R code is demonstrating how to read two separate CSC Agility XLS workbook reports, and compare which blueprints have been added, and which blueprints have been removed.

This is based on Damon Hatchett's Python code that creates the report out of CSC Agility.
